# revIgniter â€“ what is it

revIgniter is a Web Application Development Framework primarily modeled on CodeIgniter, Ellislab, Inc. This framework is a toolkit for people who build websites using LiveCode. It empowers you to develop web projects in a fraction of time compared to writing LiveCode code from scratch by providing a large number of code libraries addressing frequently needed tasks, as well as a straightforward interface and consequential pattern to access these libraries. revIgniter lets you creatively concentrate on your project by lessen the quantity of code required for a given task.
